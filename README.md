LingoMalay is a mobile application developed using Flutter that enables users to record, upload, and transcribe Malay speechâ€”specifically focused on dialects such as Kedah and Kelantan. Powered by fine-tuned Whisper models and integrated with Mesolitica's APIs, the app also supports user authentication, audio management, and real-time inference.

The project was built for research purposes to explore dialect-sensitive transcription and is integrated with Firebase for authentication, data storage, and real-time updates.
